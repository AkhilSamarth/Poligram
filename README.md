# Poligram

Try Poligram yourself at https://poligram.herokuapp.com!

Poligram is a web app dedicated to providing political information created by myself and three classmates. It uses several popular web technologies, including React, Python-Flask, and PostgreSQL. Each member of our group performed full-stack development, ensuring that we all gained exposure to all parts (front-end and back-end) of the app. We used the same kind of pull-request-based workflow commonly used in professional settings. This, combined with frequent Scrum meetings, allowed us to smoothly and easily develop a clean, professional finished product. Hope you enjoy and find this useful!

Huge thanks to Sresht Rengesh and Hasan Intisar, two professional software developers who provided us with guidance and advice throughout the course of this project!
